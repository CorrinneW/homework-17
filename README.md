# Fitness Tracker App
Uses MongoDB and Mongoose to store and return a user's workouts.

## The Goal
Build an app that allows a user to input workout information and receive detailed visual data about their exercise habits.

## What I Did
1. Created an MongoDB Atlas cluster, to which a database was added.
2. Created a Workout schema using Mongoose to hold all exercises in a workout.
4. Built api and html navigation routes
5. Deployed to Heroku
